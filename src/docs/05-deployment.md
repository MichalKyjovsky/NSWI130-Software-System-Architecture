## Deployment - DEV environment

This section describes the various containers of the Hospital Building Maintanace System for the DEV stage. This means that this scheme represents the HBMS configuration that can be deployed to the Hospital's live environment, yet it is intended more for debugging and testing purposes. Further stages such as UAT or PROD may require further container division.
