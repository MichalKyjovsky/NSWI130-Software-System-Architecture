## Context

NODC stores metadata records about all open data sets published by individual open data publishers in Czechia and enables open data consumers to search for metadata records and view their details.
Open data publishers do not register metadata records about their data sets directly to NODC.
They operate their own local open data catalogs where they manage their records.
NODC harvests the records from the local catalogs registered in the registry of local open data catalogs on a regular basis (daily).
European Open Data Catalog uses NODC as a single source of truth about open data sets in Czechia.
