      "content" : "## Context\n\nWe are developing the Building Maintenance for the Hospital. The Hospital is organized into floors and sections (rooms). These rooms are categorized onto:\n- **Rooms for patients** (*out of scope of these requirements*)\n- **Other rooms** - shared rooms, operating rooms, halls, etc. \n\nThe application will be used by the qualified employees which have appropriate rights to use our software. We will be using already implemented database of the Hospital's employees, therefore; all information about the particular employee is already known.\n\n#### Functional Requirements:\n\nThe following section summarizes the *Functional Requirements* of the project in a non-formatted way. Please feel free to extend any additional remarks or observations. \n\n- User-friendly (intuitive) visualization of the hospital, so the employee can easily orientate. (We are not required to develop mockups or wireframes but consider how possible choices of visualization affects the SW Architecture)\nEach room/section has an associated collection of **states** of each of the devices that our application can handle, i.e., *window - opened/closed*, *air-condition - on/off*, etc.\n-  Each floor has associated the cleaning devices that can be scheduled and triggered automatically by our system\n   -  We can expect that there are no barriers on the floor that our application should consider, i.e., stairs \n   -  We can expect that the device is connected to the PAN, has a unique ID, variable API (depends on the constructor of the particular device), and its firmware is somehow intelligent\n   -  We should consider that the APIs of the devices vary and can be changed, replaced or if the new device is acquired, then it is not yet supported\n   -  The cleaning devices can be scheduled to perform tasks and the proper time - even periodically\n   -  Consider the behavior of the devices at the risk situations - battery low/ lack of the internet, etc.\n   -  Addition of new devices or removal of the obsolete ones\n   -  Track the history of the particular devices, i.e., who configured it last time, etc.\n   -  We do not have to consider user-rights system (either consider that this is taken care of out of the box or prepare your system for the right access check)\n   -  Authentication and authorization process (can be dependent on outer services)\n   -  We can expect outer services that could help our purposes yet are out of the scope of this project\n   -  The architecture should be moreover universal for Web/Mobile platforms (This could be tricky since web-servers, reverse-proxies, or monitoring won't be present on the mobile device - depends - to be discussed)\n   -  Consider the physical/manual interaction with the devices simultaneously with the automated one - prepare precedence behavior/fallback strategies\n\n\n#### Non-Functional Requirements\n\nThe following section summarizes our system's *Non-Functional Requirements* that should be considered and reflected in the architecture. Those requirements are mainly targeted to reduce the overall costs, duration of the development, and the entire system's final complexity.\n\n- The system should consider the security constraints\n- The system should be designed efficiently considering the performance\n- The system should be scalable and extensible\n- The system should be designed in a way to support newly acquired devices easily\n- The system should be robust\n\nAll architectonical decisions that consider the points listed above must be documented within the output diagrams.\n\n![](embed:hospitalBuildingMaintananceSystemContextDiagram)"

      "content" : "## Decomposition of the Architecture\n\nThe following chapter provides a decomposition and description of each container that is subject to our system.\n\n\n![Hospital Building Maintanance Container Diagram](embed:hospitalBuildingMaintananceContainerDiagram)\n\n### HBMS Web Front-End\nThe purpose of this container is to introduce the graphical user interface both for the administrator of the application and the regular user.\n\n\n### HBMS Server\nThe following container represents the core functionality and business logic of our application. Our architecture acts as a controller over the model components (Device Data Manager, User Data Manager). Among other responsibilities and the most important one of the components is the interaction with devices in the hospital.  \n\n\n### Device Data Manager\nTBD\n\n### User Data Manager\nTBD\n\n### Device Updater\nThe last container our system consists of is the ***Device Updater***. The ***Device Updater*** is responsible for the maintenance of the particular device, checking the version of its firmware and software, and the overall status. Furthermore, it provides updates and upgrades for the devices that are connected to the network and are actively deployed to the service.\n\nFirstly we must declare that the responsibility of storing and managing the drivers was let upon to a standalone service which is not part of our system. Assuming that such a component will exist in the hospital's ecosystem was taken because other devices must be registered within a hospital and require regular drivers, firmware, or system maintenance. Therefore, having this assumption, we will be only querying the issued component and reducing our system's overall complexity and data redundancy. \n\n\n![Device Updater Component](embed:deviceUpdater)\n\nThe utilization of the updater will be enabled using the Admin UI. That literally means that the regular user will not have an access to the maintanance of the particular device. \n\n\n#### Workflow Scenario\n\nThe component will periodically scan the devices that will be grouped based on the common metric (modifiable - sector, producer, area of usage). **Update Intallation Trigger** will based on the **Update Manager** invocation starts the devices scan. First, the confirmation that the version index were updated and varies from the current devices version is performed. Based on the outcome of this subprocess either the updates end or continues to the **Update Planner**. The **Update Planner** will construct the most suitable schedule for update of the particular device so its regular or planned service is not affected anyhow. The constructed schedulle is then propagated to the ***Trigger*** component so it can be via ***Manager*** propagated to the particular device. This process must be synchronized and strongly relies on the schedulle status flag so the planning cannot be dead-locked by another system interaction. Finally the ***Manager*** posts the tasks to the ***Update Installation Worker***, which will handle the installation and update process for each device individually without any limitation to the system.\n <!-- TODO: Consider the limitation of the container interaction with the external entities. This could be moved to the HBMS Server, so the comunication with the devices is kept under one container. However, this could cause the performance issues considering all other functionalities that the server contaiener must span. Discuss this!  -->\n\n#### Automatic update & upgrade resolution\n\nFirst of all the system must be able to track the current version of the drivers, firmawares and software on each device. This can be done by the decomposition and categorization of the devices. Then in the scheduled intervals can be devices validated against the version of its system dependencies against the **Devices Registry** which stores the information about the most recent drivers, firmware and software required. The component then verifies that the device can be updated based on the versions resolution. When the device is about to be updated, the component then post request to a planner component which plans the regular update window for a device, so it won't affect the service. \n\n#### Update Manager\n\nThe container must communicate with others container. Firstly we need to provide the REST-API to Fron-End service, so the ***admin panel*** can visualize real-time data and statuses.\n <!-- TODO: Consider decomposing this component so the REST-API remains standalone service and some kind of publisher will post/get the data to/from the server  -->\nAnother responsibilty of the manager is to exchange the metadata information with the server, so the appropriate operaions can be performed. For an instance to set the valid state to a device that is under update check - so the schedulle modification are locked."

Literally, it can be janitor, cleaner, nurse. The use-cases of such user is to interact with the devices that have direct relation to the sector they are placed (lights, window, aircondition) and with devices intended for cleaning (hovers, window-cleaners). In addition user must be able to see the history of the particular device - hence last queries/commads and their invoker. Finally, the user must have an option to contact the support if they face any technical difficulties. \n\n\n#### Administrator\n\nAdministrator is responsible for maintaining access to the particular sectors and to the particular user. If the automatic resolving of the devices upgrades and updates fails, they must be provided with the graphical user interface enabling the manual configuration of the update/upgrade procedures. \n\n#### Device\n\nThe device represents the entity that is contolled with our application. Device interacts with our application to obtain the new drivers, firmware and software. Among other use-cases belongs the continuos state reporting, so the user are acknowledged about the state of the particular device. \n\n##### TODO: Define device states (unify on some level of abstraction)"
